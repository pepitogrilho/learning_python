# There are 3 main types of modules:
# 1) STANDARD LIBRARY = Preinstalled = Python Core
# 2) Installed from EXTERNAL SOURCES
# 3) Installed by USER (you)

# 1) STANDARD LIBRARY
# The Standard Library has modules:
# - Specific for Windows
# - Specific for Linux/Unix

# 2) from EXTERNAL SOURCES
# - many of them are stored on the PIP = PyPI = Python Package Index
#     > run pip from the command line, not the Python interpreter!!!
# - many of them are not : you have to install by yourself, without pip
